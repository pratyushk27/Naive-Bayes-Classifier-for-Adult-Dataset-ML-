# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-for-Adult-Dataset-ML-

# Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a Naive Bayes classifier to predict income levels based on demographic and socioeconomic attributes from the Adult dataset. By analyzing features such as age, education, occupation, and marital status, we aim to classify individuals into two income groups: <=50K and >50K.

* Dataset: The dataset used in this project is the Adult dataset

# Methodology:
* Data Preprocessing:Load the Adult dataset and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the distribution of income levels and analyze relationships between features and target variable using visualizations such as 
                                   histograms, bar plots, and correlation matrices.
                                   Identify potential patterns, trends, and outliers in the data.
* Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features that have a significant impact on predicting income levels.
                     Use techniques like chi-square test, information gain, or domain knowledge to determine feature importance.
